# _React Template_

## _DO NOT TOUCH THE `Webpack-dev-server` dependency unless you know what your doing. If you update it there will be errors that break the application!_

#### _This is a template using webpack for React, 04/15/19_

#### By _**Ryan McLean**_

## Description

<!-- include thoughts on the difference in development process in angular and react -->

_This is a template that has been created for anyone to use. Clone it down and it will work. This template also includes scss styling_

_styling in react is probably the biggest difference that I am dealing with in the change from angular to react. It is odd not using a traditional stylesheet but it is nice to have everything associated with a single component to be located in a single jsx file_
